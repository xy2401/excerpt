# Hierarchical Queries

If a table contains hierarchical data, then you can select rows in a hierarchical order using the hierarchical query clause:

hierarchical_query_clause::=

![Description of hierarchical_query_clause.gif follows][2]  
[Description of the illustration hierarchical_query_clause.gif][3]  


`START` `WITH` specifies the root row(s) of the hierarchy.

`CONNECT` `BY` specifies the relationship between parent rows and child rows of the hierarchy.

* The `NOCYCLE` parameter instructs Oracle Database to return rows from a query even if a `CONNECT` `BY` `LOOP` exists in the data. Use this parameter along with the `CONNECT_BY_ISCYCLE` pseudocolumn to see which rows contain the loop. Please refer to [CONNECT_BY_ISCYCLE Pseudocolumn][4] for more information.
* In a hierarchical query, one expression in `condition` must be qualified with the `PRIOR` operator to refer to the parent row. For example,

        ... PRIOR expr = expr
    or
    ... expr = PRIOR expr



If the `CONNECT` `BY` `condition` is compound, then only one condition requires the `PRIOR` operator, although you can have multiple `PRIOR` conditions. For example:

        CONNECT BY last_name != 'King' AND PRIOR employee_id = manager_id ...
    CONNECT BY PRIOR employee_id = manager_id and
               PRIOR account_mgr_id = customer_id ...



`PRIOR` is a unary operator and has the same precedence as the unary + and - arithmetic operators. It evaluates the immediately following expression for the parent row of the current row in a hierarchical query.

`PRIOR` is most commonly used when comparing column values with the equality operator. (The `PRIOR` keyword can be on either side of the operator.) `PRIOR` causes Oracle to use the value of the parent row in the column. Operators other than the equal sign (=) are theoretically possible in `CONNECT` `BY` clauses. However, the conditions created by these other operators can result in an infinite loop through the possible combinations. In this case Oracle detects the loop at run time and returns an error.

Both the `CONNECT` `BY` condition and the `PRIOR` expression can take the form of an uncorrelated subquery. However, the `PRIOR` expression cannot refer to a sequence. That is, `CURRVAL` and `NEXTVAL` are not valid `PRIOR` expressions.

You can further refine a hierarchical query by using the `CONNECT_BY_ROOT` operator to qualify a column in the select list. This operator extends the functionality of the `CONNECT` `BY` [`PRIOR`] condition of hierarchical queries by returning not only the immediate parent row but all ancestor rows in the hierarchy.

See Also:

[CONNECT_BY_ROOT][5] for more information about this operator and ["Hierarchical Query Examples"][6]

Oracle processes hierarchical queries as follows:

* A join, if present, is evaluated first, whether the join is specified in the `FROM` clause or with `WHERE` clause predicates.
* The `CONNECT` `BY` condition is evaluated.
* Any remaining `WHERE` clause predicates are evaluated.

Oracle then uses the information from these evaluations to form the hierarchy using the following steps:

1. Oracle selects the root row(s) of the hierarchy--those rows that satisfy the `START` `WITH` condition.

2. Oracle selects the child rows of each root row. Each child row must satisfy the condition of the `CONNECT` `BY` condition with respect to one of the root rows.

3. Oracle selects successive generations of child rows. Oracle first selects the children of the rows returned in step [2][7], and then the children of those children, and so on. Oracle always selects children by evaluating the `CONNECT` `BY` condition with respect to a current parent row.

4. If the query contains a `WHERE` clause without a join, then Oracle eliminates all rows from the hierarchy that do not satisfy the condition of the `WHERE` clause. Oracle evaluates this condition for each row individually, rather than removing all the children of a row that does not satisfy the condition.

5. Oracle returns the rows in the order shown in [Figure 9-1][8]. In the diagram, children appear below their parents. For an explanation of hierarchical trees, see [Figure 3-1, "Hierarchical Tree"][9].

Figure 9-1 Hierarchical Queries

![Description of Figure 9-1 follows][10]  
[Description of "Figure 9-1 Hierarchical Queries"][11]  


To find the children of a parent row, Oracle evaluates the `PRIOR` expression of the `CONNECT` `BY` condition for the parent row and the other expression for each row in the table. Rows for which the condition is true are the children of the parent. The `CONNECT` `BY` condition can contain other conditions to further filter the rows selected by the query. The `CONNECT` `BY` condition cannot contain a subquery.

If the `CONNECT` `BY` condition results in a loop in the hierarchy, then Oracle returns an error. A loop occurs if one row is both the parent (or grandparent or direct ancestor) and a child (or a grandchild or a direct descendent) of another row.

Note:

In a hierarchical query, do not specify either `ORDER` `BY` or `GROUP` `BY`, as they will destroy the hierarchical order of the `CONNECT` `BY` results. If you want to order rows of siblings of the same parent, then use the `ORDER` `SIBLINGS` `BY` clause. See [order_by_clause][12] .

## Hierarchical Query Examples

CONNECT BY Example&nbsp;The following hierarchical query uses the `CONNECT` `BY` clause to define the relationship between employees and managers:


    SELECT employee_id, last_name, manager_id
       FROM employees
       CONNECT BY PRIOR employee_id = manager_id;

    EMPLOYEE_ID LAST_NAME                 MANAGER_ID
    ----------- ------------------------- ----------
            101 Kochhar                          100
            108 Greenberg                        101
            109 Faviet                           108
            110 Chen                             108
            111 Sciarra                          108
            112 Urman                            108
            113 Popp                             108
            200 Whalen                           101
    ...


LEVEL Example&nbsp;The next example is similar to the preceding example, but uses the `LEVEL` pseudocolumn to show parent and child rows:


    SELECT employee_id, last_name, manager_id, LEVEL
       FROM employees
       CONNECT BY PRIOR employee_id = manager_id;

    EMPLOYEE_ID LAST_NAME                 MANAGER_ID      LEVEL
    ----------- ------------------------- ---------- ----------
            101 Kochhar                          100          1
            108 Greenberg                        101          2
            109 Faviet                           108          3
            110 Chen                             108          3
            111 Sciarra                          108          3
            112 Urman                            108          3
            113 Popp                             108          3
    ...


START WITH Examples&nbsp;The next example adds a `START` `WITH` clause to specify a root row for the hierarchy and an `ORDER` `BY` clause using the `SIBLINGS` keyword to preserve ordering within the hierarchy:


    SELECT last_name, employee_id, manager_id, LEVEL
          FROM employees
          START WITH employee_id = 100
          CONNECT BY PRIOR employee_id = manager_id
          ORDER SIBLINGS BY last_name;

    LAST_NAME                 EMPLOYEE_ID MANAGER_ID      LEVEL
    ------------------------- ----------- ---------- ----------
    King                              100                     1
    Cambrault                         148        100          2

    ...



In the `hr.employees` table, the employee Steven King is the head of the company and has no manager. Among his employees is John Russell, who is the manager of department 80. If we update the `employees` table to set Russell as King's manager, we will create a loop in the data:


    UPDATE employees SET manager_id = 145
       WHERE employee_id = 100;

    SELECT last_name "Employee",
       LEVEL, SYS_CONNECT_BY_PATH(last_name, '/') "Path"
       FROM employees
       WHERE level &lt;= 3 AND department_id = 80
       START WITH last_name = 'King'
       CONNECT BY PRIOR employee_id = manager_id AND LEVEL &lt;= 4;
      2    3    4    5    6    7  ERROR:
    ORA-01436: CONNECT BY loop in user data



The `NOCYCLE` parameter in the `CONNECT` `BY` condition causes Oracle to return the rows in spite of the loop. The `CONNECT_BY_ISCYCLE` pseudocolumn shows you which rows contain the cycle:


    SELECT last_name "Employee", CONNECT_BY_ISCYCLE "Cycle",
       LEVEL, SYS_CONNECT_BY_PATH(last_name, '/') "Path"
       FROM employees
       WHERE level &lt;= 3 AND department_id = 80
       START WITH last_name = 'King'
       CONNECT BY NOCYCLE PRIOR employee_id = manager_id AND LEVEL &lt;= 4;

    Employee                   Cycle  LEVEL Path

CONNECT_BY_ROOT Examples&nbsp;The following example returns the last name of each employee in department 110, each manager above that employee in the hierarchy, the number of levels between manager and employee, and the path between the two:


    SELECT last_name "Employee", CONNECT_BY_ROOT last_name "Manager",
       LEVEL-1 "Pathlen", SYS_CONNECT_BY_PATH(last_name, '/') "Path"
       FROM employees
       WHERE LEVEL &gt; 1 and department_id = 110
       CONNECT BY PRIOR employee_id = manager_id;

    Employee        Manager         Pathlen Path
    --------------- ------------ ---------- -----------------------------------
    Higgins         Kochhar               1 /Kochhar/Higgins
    Gietz           Kochhar               2 /Kochhar/Higgins/Gietz
    Gietz           Higgins               1 /Higgins/Gietz
    Higgins         King                  2 /King/Kochhar/Higgins
    Gietz           King                  3 /King/Kochhar/Higgins/Gietz



The following example uses a `GROUP` `BY` clause to return the total salary of each employee in department 110 and all employees below that employee in the hierarchy:


    SELECT name, SUM(salary) "Total_Salary" FROM (
       SELECT CONNECT_BY_ROOT last_name as name, Salary
          FROM employees
          WHERE department_id = 110
          CONNECT BY PRIOR employee_id = manager_id)
          GROUP BY name;

    NAME                      Total_Salary
    ------------------------- ------------
    Gietz                             8300
    Higgins                          20300
    King                             20300
    Kochhar                          20300
