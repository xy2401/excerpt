# Maven – Welcome to Apache Maven

## Welcome to Apache Maven

Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.

If you think that Maven could help your project, you can find out more information about in the "About Maven" section of the navigation. This includes an in-depth description of [what Maven is][1], a [list of some of its main features][2], and a set of [frequently asked questions about what Maven is][3].

This site is separated into the following sections, depending on how you'd like to use Maven:

| Use  |  [Download][4], [Install][5], [Run][6] Maven  |  [Configure][7], [Use][8] Maven and [Maven Plugins][9]  |  
|----|----|----|----|----|
|  |  Information for those needing to build a project that uses Maven |  Information for those wanting to use Maven to build their project, including a "10 minute test" that gives a practical overview of Maven's main features in just 10 minutes and [plugin list][9] for more information on each plugin  |  
| Extend |  [Write Maven Plugins][10] |  [Improve the Maven Central Repository][11] |  
|  |  Information for those who want to provide a Maven plugin for shared functionality or to accompany their own product or toolset  |  Information for those who may or may not use Maven, but are interested in getting project metadata into the [central repository][11]  |  
| Contribute |  [Help Maven][12] |  [Develop Maven][13] |  
|  |  Information if you'd like to get involved: Maven is an open source community and welcomes contributions.  |  Information for those who are currently developers, or who are interested in contributing to the Maven project itself  |

Each guide is divided into a number of trails to get you started on a particular topic, and includes a reference area and a "cookbook" of common examples.

You can access the guides at any time from the left navigation. If you are looking for a quick reference, you can use the [documentation index][14].

### How to Get Support

Support for Maven is available in a variety of different forms.

To get started, search the documentation, [issue tracker][15], the [wiki][16] or the [mailing list archives][17] to see if the problem has been solved or reported before.

If the problem has not been reported before, the recommended way to get help is to subscribe to the [Maven Users Mailing list][17]. Many other users and Maven developers will answer your questions there, and the answer will be archived for others in the future.

You can also reach the Maven developers on [IRC][18].

Maven is a part of the Apache Software Foundation. We'd like to [thank the sponsors][19] that provide financial assistance to the foundation. For more information on how you can support the foundation, see the [sponsorship][20] page.
