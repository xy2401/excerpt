### Spring Boot

#### Build Anything

Spring Boot is designed to get you up and running as quickly as possible, with minimal upfront configuration of Spring. Spring Boot takes an opinionated view of building production ready applications.

### Spring Cloud

#### Coordinate Anything

Built directly on Spring Boot's innovative approach to enterprise Java, Spring Cloud simplifies distributed, microservice-style architecture by implementing proven patterns to bring resilience, reliability, and coordination to your microservices.

### Spring Cloud Data Flow

#### Connect Anything

Connect the Enterprise to the Internet of Anything-mobile devices, sensors, wearables, automobiles, and more. Spring Cloud Data Flow provides a unified service for creating composable data microservices that address streaming and ETL-based data processing patterns.

## Spring Framework 5

#### The Right Technology Stack for the Job at Hand

Developers are constantly challenged with choosing the most effective runtime, programming model and architecture for their application's requirements and team's skill-set. For example, some [use cases][16] are best handled by a technology stack based on synchronous blocking I/O architecture while others would be better served by an asynchronous, and non-blocking stack built on the reactive design principles described in the [Reactive Streams Specification][17].

Reactive Spring represents a platform wide initiative to deliver reactive support at every level of the development stack—web, security, data, messaging, etc. Spring Framework 5 delivers on this vision by providing a new reactive web stack called, Spring WebFlux, which is offered side-by-side with the traditional Spring MVC web stack. The choice is yours!
